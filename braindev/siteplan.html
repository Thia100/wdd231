              <strong>I'm a complete beginner, where should I start?</strong>
              <p>
                As a complete beginner, we recommend starting with our "Code
                Foundations" Path. This path is designed to ease you into the
                world of programming without any prerequisite knowledge. You'll
                begin with Python, which is widely considered the best first
                language due to its simple, readable syntax.

              >
              <p>
                It costs zero naira! Our goal is to provide the best free
                learning tools to get you from beginner ➡️ Pro at your own pace.

                >What is the difference between Python, JavaScript, and
                Java?</strong
              >
              <p>
                Python, JavaScript, and Java are distinct tools for different
                tasks. Python is the best starting point for beginners, known
                for its clean, simple syntax, and is primarily used for data
                science, machine learning, and server-side web development.
                JavaScript is the indispensable language of the web, responsible
                for all the interactive elements you see in your browser, and
                it's the only choice for front-end development, though it can
                also handle the back end via Node.js. Java is the language for
                building large-scale enterprise applications and native Android
                mobile apps; it has a stricter, more complex structure that
                ensures speed and stability for massive systems.
